# Parking-Register
 A basic parking register app, built with KivyMd and Python.

* #### How to use:
    #### Console application
    This app consists of basic console app which can be run with opening
    parking_lib.py file as main. Three classes are implemented Checking,
    which contains more mature methods for using the Database class, which 
    basically implements most of the application logics.
    Test class contains some additional functions for providing some example data 
    and other test purposes. It may change or be excluded at any time.

    #### KivyMd UI
    This application contains basic Kivymd UI, which implements some 
    console methods, provided by the console library. Yet this interface is not
    quite functional and rather exemplary by the moment.
    KivyMd interface consists of three files: kivymd_main.py, kivymd_table.py and
    kivymd_register.py. In order to run the interface only kivymd_main.py should be run.
    The other files may not run correctly or at all as standalone files.
    The required libraries to run this project is KivyMD 1.1.0 which is based on Kivy 2.0.0+
